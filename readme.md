## Start Server
To start the server immediately, just tpye the following:
(The script you run also contains the code to install the package.)
```bash
yarn start
```
If you want to run the server with the dev configuration, type the following code:
```bash
yarn dev
```
However, the difference from the code that runs the server (yarn start) is that the server running as dev automatically
restarts the server when a code change is detected.

If you want to manually install the package yourself, 
run the following yarn code below:
```bash
yarn install
```
Additionally, you can check the operation of the server [here](/ho4607/how-muscle-server/package.json).
